    "\n",
    "In python the flow of code through a program can be controlled by a variety of different types of statements. In this notebook we consider ```if```, ```for```  and ```while``` statements, but you may also come across ```try``` statements (which specify exception handlers and/or cleanup code) or ```with``` statements (which allows execution of initialization and finalization code, prior to running a block of code).\n",

This references how variables are either copied to a new place in memory when they are passed to a function (pass by value) or whether their memory address is passed and shared with the function argument (pass by reference).
