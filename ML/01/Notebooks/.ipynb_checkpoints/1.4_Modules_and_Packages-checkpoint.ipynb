    "Thus, in order to write more complex programs it is important to be able to write code in carefully organised and structured files that can then be accessed from the main program. To support this Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance. This type of file is called a _Module_. Groups of related modules can be used to create _Packages_. As Python is open source and utlised by a broad community in research in industry a wide variety of advanced packages for Machine Learning and Statistical Packages have been developed and are well supported and documented.\n",
