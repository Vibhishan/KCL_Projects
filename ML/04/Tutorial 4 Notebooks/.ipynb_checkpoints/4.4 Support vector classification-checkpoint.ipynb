    "In this notebook we will explore Support Vector Classifier (SVC). Linear binary SVC is very similar to the perceptron and logistic regression in a sense that it finds the optimal hyperplane to separate two classes. These methods, however, have different objectives through which they decide what is the optimal decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three different SVC classifiers in `sklearn` library:\n",
    "1. `LinearSVC` implements linear classifier optimised for performance but does not support the kernel trick\n",
    "2. `SVC` implements SVC with kernel trick. Setting `kernel='linear'` produces the same result as `LinearSVC` but is less efficient in terms of computational time. Setting `kernel='rbf'` produces non-linear classifier with Gaussian kernel.\n",
    "3. `SGDclassifier` implements various classifiers that are optimised using stochastic gradient descent. Its default setting for loss function is `loss='hinge'` which is another implementation of a linear SVC.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVC result also depends on hyperparameter `C` which controls the width of the margin and regularises the decision function. Larger `C` means smaller margin, less regularisation, and closer approximation of hard margin objective. Smaller `C` means larger margin, and smoother boundary for non-linear SVC. Note, that `C` has an opposite role to the parameter `alpha` that we used for penalised regression (e.g. `Ridge`). This is because it multiplies the data term rather than the penalty term.\n",
