    "A cutting edge research company is marketing a product for tracking scientific trials. These trials involve multiple subjects (human or otherwise) with multiple experiments. This needs to be stored in a large database with an interface accessible by researchers to input data and to query information. Applying analysis algorithms to this data is one anticipated usage. The development team is relatively small but composed of experienced developers. The company is working with a research group so there will be scientists on hand to collaborate with. There is a working version but new enhancements need to be made and delivering soon and frequently thereafter is a priority to get to market."

    "A cutting edge research company markets a product for using medical images to improve the effectiveness of radiotherapy treatment. The system is used by expert technicians during radiotherapy sessions. The company has a team of researchers who are constantly developing new algorithms that may need to be incorporated into the product. This is a competitive market in which fast delivery of new functionality will give the company the edge. The company also have a team of in-house developers who are tasked with integrating the new algorithms into the product. The development team are highly skilled and all based at the companyâ€™s head office with the researchers. Engagement with the researchers and clinicians is high as the software must integrate with clinical workflows and refining how it works to do this requires a lot of interaction with these groups. The software engineering project is the integration of the new algorithms into the radiotherapy product. "
